        Notes:
            Since TDIDT is an eager learning algorithm, this method builds a decision tree model
                from the training data.
            Build a decision tree using the nested list representation described in class.
            On a majority vote tie, choose first attribute value based on attribute domain ordering.
            Store the tree in the tree attribute.
            Use attribute indexes to construct default attribute names (e.g. "att0", "att1", ...).
