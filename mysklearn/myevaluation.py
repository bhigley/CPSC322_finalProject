# Description: This program contains functions for various methods of splitting up data into
# training and testing. Some of them return list of lists for multiple iterations of testing to 
# have a more comprehensive set of testing data while the bootsrap method does not really do this.
# The final two functions are built for analysis and visualization purposes so we can interpret
# what our metric are like. 
#
# We can utilize this functionality for our mypytable to better split up our data allowing us to run better
# predictions
